# Business-Intelligence-Tool
Business Intelligence refers to tools/applications/practices for collecting/analyzing/presenting an organizationâ€™s raw data to insightful and actionable business information. A business intelligence tool aids an organization in the following ways: 
- Helps corporate executives/business managers etc. to make better and more informed business decisions using technology. 
- Identifying new business opportunities. 
- Spotting inefficient business processes ripe for re-engineering. 

Our project aimed at designing such a tool for sales data which would provide intelligence to the business entity in the form of various analysis methods and optimization techniques.
